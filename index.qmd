<b>Hi, I'm Toufiq.</b>
```

<br>I am an applied microeconomist. My research leverages modern econometric tools to address questions relevant to health, education, and labor policies.

I recently completed Ph.D. in Economics from Georgia State University and will be joining Johns Hopkins University Carey Business School as a Postdoc this fall.

<summary>Do Incentives Shape Teacher Effort? Lessons from a Piece-rate Bonus Program<font color="#000FF"; size="2"> [Job Market Paper]</font> <font size="2"> <br>(with Ian Callen)</font></summary>
<p class="fulljustify">
We study the effects of a novel piece-rate teacher bonus program on student outcomes. We propose a model implying that the piece-rate and the cap generate higher incentives for teachers with relatively lower baseline student number and aptitude. The model further predicts that the bonus program does not effectively incentivize teachers with a high baseline number of students passing the AP exams, since they are likely to automatically qualify for the maximum reward without exerting additional effort. Leveraging course-level student-teacher linked data and using both teacher fixed effects and difference-in-differences models, we provide evidence supporting the model implications. We find that the bonus program increased the probability of a course leading to a passed exam by approximately 2 percentage points. We also document an approximately 2-2.5 percentage point increase in the pass rates among students instructed by teachers for whom the bonus cap was non-binding, relative to those instructed by teachers earning near-maximum bonus amount before the program implementation.

From Coverage to Consequences: BMI and Health Behaviors after Medicaid Contraction<br><font size="2"></font></summary>

<p class="fulljustify">

Leveraging Tennessee’s 2005 Medicaid contraction, I study the impact of losing public health insurance on body weight and relevant health behaviors. Using Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data from 1997 to 2010, I estimate comparative case study models with data-driven control groups. The preferred synthetic difference-in-differences estimates suggest that the reform increased Body Mass Index by 0.38 points and the overweight or obesity prevalence (BMI≥25) by ∼4% among Tennessean childless adults. My findings—a 21% increase in the share of childless adults reporting poor health, declines in Medicaid-supported use of pain and antiinflammatory medications, and reduced participation in moderate physical activities— suggest that worsening unmanaged health conditions may be a key pathway through which coverage loss affected physical activity and weight gain. Additionally, my analysis offers practical guidance for analyzing single treated clusters using comparative case study methods, highlighting the advantages of placebo-based standard errors for valid inference.

<summary>Removing Barriers to College Credits: How and Where AP Exam Fee Waivers Work<font size="2"> <br>(with Cade Lawson)</font></summary>
<p class="fulljustify">
We examine the impact of North Carolina's Advanced Placement (AP) exam fee waivers on exam participation and potential college credit attainment. Using course level administrative data and multiple quasi-experimental strategies, we find that fee waivers significantly increased exam participation and potential college credit attainment among high school students, particularly in underutilized AP courses, defined by below-median exam participation rates prior to the implementation of fee waivers. Although we find evidence that fee waivers reduce the exam participation gap between the underserved and more advantaged students, we do not find robust evidence that they narrow the disparity in college credit attainment. Finally, our main findings help reconcile the seemingly disparate findings from prior research on AP exam funding.
