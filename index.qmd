<summary>The Effects of Losing Medicaid on Body Weight and Health Behaviors<font color="maroon"; size="2"><i> (Job Market Paper)</i></font></summary>

<p class="fulljustify">

 Tennessee’s 2005 Medicaid reform resulted in approximately 4% of the state’s childless adults losing their health insurance coverage. Leveraging this policy-induced variation, I study the effects of Medicaid disenrollment on body weight and health behaviors. Using Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data from 1997 to 2010, I estimate synthetic difference-in-differences models that compare Tennessee’s outcomes before and after the reform with those of a data-driven, synthetic Tennessee. The results suggest that the reform led to a 0.37-point increase in BMI among Tennessean childless adults, contributing to a 4% rise in the prevalence of overweight or obese (BMI≥25) within this group. The effects were large among young adults aged 20-39 and females, who likely experienced significant coverage losses due to the reform. Examining health behaviors, I find that decreased participation in moderate physical activities (e.g., brisk walking, gardening) and inclusion of less vegetable in diet explain nearly two-third of the weight gain. Finally, the findings indicate that the effects of reducing Medicaid cov- erage on body weight and related health behaviors may not mirror those of increasing Medicaid access.

<summary>Do AP Exam Fee Waivers Improve AP Participation and Performance?<font size="2"> (with Cade Lawson & Salma Ali)</font></summary>
<p class="fulljustify">
We study the effects of North Carolina’s Advanced Placement (AP) exam fee waivers on AP course enrollment, exam taking, and exam performance. By leveraging course-level administrative data and incorporating student fixed effects, we identify causal effects while effectively overcoming the limitations of prior research. We utilize course-level administrative data and student fixed effects to identify the causal effects while addressing several limitations of the prior studies. We find that the fee waivers increase the likelihood of an AP course to result in an Exam by nearly 4 percentage points ( 6%), but does not decrease the probability of passing the test. In contrast to previous studies, we find no effect on AP course enrollment. We provide evidence that the fee waivers reduce racial gap in AP participation.
