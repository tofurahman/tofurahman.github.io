    <p class="greeting"><b>Hi, I'm Toufiq.</b></p>
    <p>I am an applied microeconomist. My research applies rigorous quasi-experimental and machine learning methods to large datasets to measure the causal effects of economic policies and incentives. My work has examined the impact of performance-based teacher bonuses, the role of AP exam fee waivers on college-credit attainment, and the health consequences of public insurance contractions.</p>
    <p>I am currently a Research Assistant (Postdoc) at the Johns Hopkins Carey Business School. I received my Ph.D. in Economics from Georgia State University.</p>
