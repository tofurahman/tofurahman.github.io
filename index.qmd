<summary>Effects of Losing Medicaid on Body Weight and Health Behaviors<font color="#1da2d8"; size="2"><i> (Job Market Paper) [<u>Under Review</u>]</i></font></summary>

<p class="fulljustify">

Tennessee’s 2005 Medicaid reform terminated public health insurance coverage for approximately 170,000 childless adults. Leveraging this policy-induced variation, I study the impact of losing public health insurance on body weight and related health behaviors. Using Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data from 1997 to 2010, I estimate comparative case study models that compare Tennessee’s outcomes before and after the reform with those of data-driven control groups. The preferred synthetic difference-in-differences estimates suggest that the reform increased Body Mass Index by 0.37 points and the overweight or obesity prevalence (BMI≥25) by 4% among Tennessean childless adults. Examining health behaviors, I find evidence supporting weight gain through reduction in moderate physical activity participation (e.g., brisk walking, gardening) and vegetable consumption.

<summary>Unlocking Potential: The Impacts of North Carolina's AP Exam Fee Waivers<font size="2"> (with Cade Lawson)</font></summary>
<p class="fulljustify">
We study the effects of North Carolina's Advanced Placement (AP) exam fee waivers on AP course enrollment, exam taking, and exam performance. Using course-level administrative data and exploiting within student variation, we identify the causal effects while overcoming several limitations of prior research. We find no evidence that fee waivers increased AP enrollment. However, fee waivers increased the likelihood of an AP course leading to an exam by 4 percentage points, with no negative impact on pass rates. The gains were significantly higher among minority and economically disadvantaged students, reducing the racial and socioeconomic gap in AP exam participation by one-third. A back-of-the-envelope cost-benefit analysis suggests that the implied tuition savings alone exceed the cost of subsidizing AP exams.

<summary>Incentive Strength and Teacher Effort: New Evidence from a Piece-rate Bonus Scheme</summary>
<p class="fulljustify">
Do piece-rate teacher bonus programs improve student outcomes? Does teacher effort increase with expected reward? I examine these questions in the context of North Carolina's Advanced Placement (AP) teacher bonus program, which rewards AP teachers $50 per student passing the linked AP exam since 2015-2016 School Year. Exploiting temporal variation in outcomes for students assigned to the same teacher, I find that teacher bonus increased AP exam pass rate by 2.5 percentage points. The estimated effect is robust to various specifications and alternative identification strategies.

<summary>Eviction in the Gig Economy</summary>
<p class="fulljustify">
Gig work is often taken up as a secondary profession to buffer against financial shocks, improving timely rent payments—the leading cause of eviction filings in the United States. This paper leverages UberX/Lyft entries to major US cities to examine the effects of Gig opportunities on eviction risk.
