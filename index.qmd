<summary>Effects of Losing Medicaid on Body Weight and Health Behaviors<font color="#1da2d8"; size="2"><i> (Job Market Paper) [<u>Under Review</u>]</i></font></summary>

<p class="fulljustify">

Tennessee’s 2005 Medicaid reform terminated public health insurance coverage for approximately 170,000 childless adults. Leveraging this policy-induced variation, I study the impact of losing public health insurance on body weight and related health behaviors. Using Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data from 1997 to 2010, I estimate comparative case study models that compare Tennessee’s outcomes before and after the reform with those of data-driven control groups. The preferred synthetic difference-in-differences estimates suggest that the reform increased Body Mass Index by 0.37 points and the overweight or obesity prevalence (BMI≥25) by 4% among Tennessean childless adults. Examining health behaviors, I find evidence supporting weight gain through reduction in moderate physical activity participation (e.g., brisk walking, gardening) and vegetable consumption.

<summary>Unlocking Potential: The Impacts of North Carolina's AP Exam Fee Waivers<font size="2"> (with Cade Lawson)</font></summary>
<p class="fulljustify">
We study the effects of North Carolina's Advanced Placement (AP) exam fee waivers on student AP outcomes and equity. Using course-level administrative data and exploiting within student variation, we identify the causal effects and present novel evidence on composition effects. We find that fee waivers increased the likelihood of an AP course leading to both an exam being taken and a passing score. However, the effect on pass rates is mainly driven by students shifting to easier-to-pass subjects. The gains were significantly higher among minority and economically disadvantaged students, reducing the racial and socioeconomic gap in AP exam participation by one-third. A back-of-the-envelope cost-benefit analysis suggests that the implied tuition savings alone exceed the cost of subsidizing AP exams.

<summary>How Incentives Shape Teacher Effort: Lessons from a Piece-rate Bonus Program</summary>
<p class="fulljustify">
I study the effects of piece-rate teacher bonus program on student outcomes. Beginning 2015-16 School year, North Carolina annually rewards an Advanced Placement (AP) teacher $50 bonus for each student in her class passing the corresponding AP exam, with total bonuses capped at $3,500 ($2,000 in SY 2015-16 only). Using the program features, I develop a simple economic model, which implies that the piece-rate structure and the cap provide disproportionate incentives to teachers with varying baseline student number and aptitude. Leveraging course-level student-teacher linked data from North Carolina and using both teacher fixed effects and difference-in-differences models, I provide evidence supporting the model implications. My main result suggests that the bonus program significantly increased pass rate among students assigned to teachers unconstrained by the bonus cap.
