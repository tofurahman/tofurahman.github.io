<b>Hi, I'm Toufiq.</b>
``` 



<br>I am an Economics PhD candidate at Georgia State University. My research leverages modern econometric tools to address questions relevant to health, education, and labor policies.

Prior to joining Georgia State University, I served as an Assistant Director at the Central Bank of Bangladesh.

I am on the 2024-25 job market and available for interviews at the upcoming ASSA meeting.

<summary>The Effects of Losing Medicaid on Body Weight and Health Behaviors<font color="maroon"; size="2"><i> (Job Market Paper)</i></font></summary>

<p class="fulljustify">

Tennessee's 2005 Medicaid reform resulted in approximately 4% of the state's childless adults losing their public health insurance coverage. Leveraging this policy-induced variation, I study the effects of Medicaid disenrollment on body weight and health behaviors. Using Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data from 1997 to 2010, I estimate comparative case study models that compare Tennessee's outcomes before and after the reform with those of a data-driven control group. The preferred synthetic difference-in-differences estimates suggest that the reform led to 0.37 kg/m^2 increase in body weight among Tennessean childless adults, contributing to a 4% rise in the prevalence of overweight or obese (BMI≥25) within this group. The effects were large among young adults aged 20 to 39 years and women, who likely experienced significant coverage losses due to the reform. Examining health behaviors, I find that decreased participation in moderate physical activities (e.g., brisk walking, gardening) and a reduction in vegetable consumption explain more than half of the weight gain. Finally, the findings indicate that the effects of Medicaid contraction on body weight and related health behaviors may not mirror those of Medicaid expansion.

<summary>Unlocking Potential: The Impact of AP Exam Fee Waivers<font size="2"> (with Cade Lawson)</font></summary>
<p class="fulljustify">
We study the effects of North Carolina's Advanced Placement (AP) exam fee waivers on AP course enrollment, exam taking, and exam performance. Using course-level administrative data and exploiting within student variation, we identify the causal effects while overcoming several limitations of prior research. We find no evidence that fee waivers increased AP enrollment. However, fee waivers increased the likelihood of an AP course leading to an exam by 3.5 percentage points, with no negative impact on pass rates. The gain was significantly higher among minority and economically disadvantaged students, reducing the racial and socioeconomic gap in AP exam taking and performance by one-third. A back-of-the-envelope cost-benefit analysis suggests that the implied tuition savings alone exceed the cost of subsidizing AP exams.
