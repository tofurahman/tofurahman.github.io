<summary>The Effects of Losing Medicaid on Body Weight and Health Behaviors<font color="maroon"; size="2"><i> (Job Market Paper)</i></font></summary>

<p class="fulljustify">

 Tennessee's 2005 Medicaid reform resulted in approximately 4% of the state's childless adults losing their health insurance coverage. Leveraging this policy-induced variation, I study the effects of Medicaid disenrollment on body weight and health behaviors. Using Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data from 1997 to 2010, I estimate synthetic difference-in-differences models that compare Tennessee's outcomes before and after the reform with those of a data-driven, synthetic Tennessee. The findings suggest  that the reform led to a 0.37-point increase in BMI among Tennessean childless adults, resulting in a 4% increase in the prevalence of overweight or obese within this group. The effects were pronounced among young adults aged 20-39 and females, who likely experienced significant coverage losses due to the reform.  Examining health behaviors, I find that decreased participation in moderate physical activity (e.g., brisk walking, gardening) and less vegetable consumption following the reform partially explain the weight gain. Finally, the evidence presented in this paper indicates that the impacts of Medicaid contraction may not mirror those of its expansion.

<summary>Do AP Exam Fee Waivers Improve AP Participation and Performance?<font size="2"> (with Cade Lawson & Salma Ali)</font></summary>
<p class="fulljustify">
We leverage policy-induced variation in the out-of-pocket cost of taking Advanced Placement (AP) exams and within student variation to examine the effects of North Carolina's AP exam fee waiver policy on AP course enrollment, exam taking, and exam performance. Our use of course-level administrative data and student fixed effects address several limitations of prior studies. We find that the fee waivers increase the likelihood of an AP enrollee to take the AP test, but does not decrease the probability of passing the test. In contrast to previous studies, we find no effect on AP course enrollment. We provide evidence that fee waivers reduce racial gap in AP exam taking and potential college credit accumulation.
