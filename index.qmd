<summary>The Effects of Losing Medicaid on Body Weight and Health Behaviors<font color="maroon"; size="2"><i> (Job Market Paper)</i></font></summary>

<p class="fulljustify">

 Tennessee’s 2005 Medicaid reform resulted in approximately 4% of the state’s childless adults losing their health insurance coverage. Leveraging this policy-induced variation, I study the effects of Medicaid disenrollment on body weight and health behaviors. Using Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data from 1997 to 2010, I estimate comparative case study models that compare Tennessee’s outcomes before and after the reform with those of a data-driven control group. The results suggest that the reform led to a 0.37-point increase in BMI among Tennessean childless adults, contributing to a 4% rise in the prevalence of overweight or obese (BMI≥25) within this group. The effects were large among young adults aged 20-39 and females, who likely experienced significant coverage losses due to the reform. Examining health behaviors, I find that decreased participation in moderate physical activities (e.g., brisk walking, gardening) and inclusion of less vegetable in diet explain nearly two-third of the weight gain. Finally, the findings indicate that the effects of restricting access to Medicaid on body weight and related health behaviors may not mirror those of increasing access.

<summary>Do AP Exam Fee Waivers Improve AP Participation and Performance?<font size="2"> (with Cade Lawson & Salma Ali)</font></summary>
<p class="fulljustify">
We study the effects of North Carolina’s Advanced Placement (AP) exam fee
waivers on AP course enrollment, exam taking, and exam performance. By leveraging
course-level administrative data and incorporating student fixed effects, we identify the causal effects while overcoming several limitations of prior research. We find that the fee waivers increase the likelihood of an AP course to result in an exam by 4 percentage points (∼6%), but do not significantly decrease the probability of resulting in a passing score. In contrast to previous studies, we find no evidence that the waivers increased AP enrollment. Finally, we provide evidence that the fee waivers reduced racial gap in AP participation.
