    <p class="greeting"><b>Hi, I'm Toufiq.</b></p>
    <p>I am an applied microeconomist specializing in Education, Labor, and Public Economics.</p>
    <p>My research agenda focuses on the production and preservation of human capital. I study how policy levers can facilitate its accumulation—examining the role of teacher incentives and financial subsidies—and whether safety nets protect its value by buffering against health and economic shocks.</p>
    
    <p>Broadly, I am interested in the incentives that govern individual behavior, with additional work exploring political economy and voting.</p>

    <p>I am currently a Postdoc at the Johns Hopkins Carey Business School. I received my Ph.D. in Economics from Georgia State University, where I was advised by Professor Daniel Kreisman and worked as a Graduate Research Assistant at Georgia Policy Labs.</p>
