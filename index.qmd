    <p class="greeting"><b>Hi, I'm Toufiq.</b></p>
    <p>I am an applied microeconomist. My research spans several fields, with primary interest in applied econometrics, labor economics, and economics of education. My current portfolio includes studies examining the effects of performance-based teacher bonuses, AP exam fee waivers, and public health insurance contractions.<br> <br>

Methodologically, my research demonstrates rigor in overcoming the challenges of causal inference. I specialize in designing identification strategies in complex settings, such as using within-student/within-teacher comparisons, exploiting specific program features (like a bonus cap), or careful application of machine learning methods to build valid counterfactuals. I also focus on contextual inferential challenges; for example, my BMI paper suggests a finite-sample correction that improves test size for inference in single treated cluster settings with limited pre-period data.</p>

    <p>I am currently a Research Assistant (Postdoc) at the Johns Hopkins Carey Business School. I received my Ph.D. in Economics from Georgia State University, where I was advised by Professor Daniel Kreisman and worked as a Graduate Research Assistant at Georgia Policy Labs.</p>
