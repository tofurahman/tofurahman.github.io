    <p class="greeting"><b>Hi, I'm Toufiq.</b></p>
    <p>I am an applied microeconomist studying human capital and behavioral responses to incentives. My research agenda focuses on the production and preservation of human capital. I study how teachers produce it (through performance incentives), how financial costs constrain it (via exam fees), and how health shocks destroy it (following insurance loss).</p>

<p>Recently, I have expanded this focus to political economy, examining how local economic shocks and firms shape voting behavior.</p>

    <p>I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Assistant at the Johns Hopkins Carey Business School. I received my Ph.D. in Economics from Georgia State University, where I was advised by Professor Daniel Kreisman and worked as a Graduate Research Assistant at Georgia Policy Labs.</p>
