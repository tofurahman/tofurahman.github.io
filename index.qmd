<b>Hi, I'm Toufiq.</b>
```

<br>I am an applied microeconomist. My research leverages modern econometric tools to address questions relevant to health, education, and labor policies.

I recently completed Ph.D. in Economics from Georgia State University and will be joining Johns Hopkins University Carey Business School as a Postdoc this fall.

<summary>Do Incentives Shape Teacher Effort? Lessons from a Piece-rate Bonus Program<font color="#000FF"; size="2"> [Job Market Paper]</font> <font size="2"> <br>(with Ian Callen)</font></summary>
<p class="fulljustify">
We study the effects of a novel piece-rate teacher bonus program on student outcomes. We propose a model implying that the piece-rate and the cap generate higher incentives for teachers with relatively lower baseline student number and aptitude. The model further predicts that the bonus program does not effectively incentivize teachers with a high baseline number of students passing the AP exams, since they are likely to automatically qualify for the maximum reward without exerting additional effort. Leveraging course-level student-teacher linked data and using both teacher fixed effects and difference-in-differences models, we provide evidence supporting the model implications. We find that the bonus program increased the probability of a course leading to a passed exam by approximately 2 percentage points. We also document an approximately 2-2.5 percentage point increase in the pass rates among students instructed by teachers for whom the bonus cap was non-binding, relative to those instructed by teachers earning near-maximum bonus amount before the program implementation.

From Coverage to Consequences: BMI and Health Behaviors after Medicaid Contraction<br>(Under Review)<font size="2"></font></summary>

<p class="fulljustify">

Leveraging Tennessee’s 2005 Medicaid contraction, I study the impact of losing public health insurance on body weight and relevant health behaviors. Using Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data from 1997 to 2010, I estimate comparative case study models with data-driven control groups. The preferred synthetic difference-in-differences estimates suggest that the reform increased Body Mass Index by 0.38 points and the overweight or obesity prevalence (BMI≥25) by ∼4% among Tennessean childless adults. My findings—a 21% increase in the share of childless adults reporting poor health, declines in Medicaid-supported use of pain and antiinflammatory medications, and reduced participation in moderate physical activities— suggest that worsening unmanaged health conditions may be a key pathway through which coverage loss affected physical activity and weight gain. Additionally, my analysis offers practical guidance for analyzing single treated clusters using comparative case study methods, highlighting the advantages of placebo-based standard errors for valid inference.

<summary>Removing Barriers to College Credits: How and Where AP Exam Fee Waivers Work<font size="2"> <br>(with Cade Lawson)</font></summary>
<p class="fulljustify">
Do policies that expand educational access also promote success? We study this question in the context of North Carolina’s Advanced Placement (AP) exam fee waivers, evaluating their impact on the likelihood that an AP course results in exam participation and in a passing score (a score of 3 or higher on the 5-point scale, generally eligible for college credit). Using administrative data and a within-student design, we find that fee waivers significantly increased AP exam participation but had no aggregate effect pass rate. This null result, however, masks a robust 3.3 percentage point increase in the pass rate for low-SES students. For underrepresented minorities and for AP courses with historically low exam participation, the estimates are imprecise but suggestive of potentially meaningful gains. In a complementary analysis using the full sample of AP courses, we show that the fee waiver’s impact was greatest in courses where exam fees posed the highest predicted financial barrier. Our findings also help reconcile the seemingly disparate results from prior research on AP exam funding.
