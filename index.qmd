<b>Hi, I'm Toufiq.</b>
```

<br>I am an applied microeconomist. My research leverages modern econometric tools to address questions relevant to health, education, and labor policies.

I recently completed Ph.D. in Economics from Georgia State University and will be joining Johns Hopkins University Carey Business School as a Postdoc this fall.

    <span class="paper-tag jmp">Job Market Paper</span>
  </div>
  <p class="paper-authors">with Ian Callen</p>
  <p class="paper-abstract">
  We study the effects of a novel piece-rate teacher bonus program on student outcomes. We propose a model implying that the piece-rate and the cap generate higher incentives for teachers with relatively lower baseline student number and aptitude. The model further predicts that the bonus program does not effectively incentivize teachers with a high baseline number of students passing the AP exams, since they are likely to automatically qualify for the maximum reward without exerting additional effort...

  </div>
  <p class="paper-abstract">
  Leveraging Tennessee’s 2005 Medicaid contraction, I study the impact of losing public health insurance on body weight and relevant health behaviors. Using Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data from 1997 to 2010, I estimate comparative case study models with data-driven control groups. The preferred synthetic difference-in-differences estimates suggest that the reform increased Body Mass Index by 0.38 points and the overweight or obesity prevalence (BMI≥25) by ∼4% among Tennessean childless adults...

  <p class="paper-abstract">
  Do policies that broaden educational access also foster success? We study this question in the context of North Carolina’s universal Advanced Placement (AP) exam fee waiver policy, analyzing its effects on the likelihood of exam participation and achieving a passing score (>=3 out of 5). Using administrative data and exploiting within-student variation, we find that fee waivers significantly increased AP exam participation but had no effect on overall pass rate among AP-enrolled students...
