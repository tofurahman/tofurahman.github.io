    <p class="greeting"><b>Hi, I'm Toufiq.</b></p>
    <p>I am an applied microeconomist specializing in education, labor, and public economics. My research agenda investigates how public policy design interacts with market frictions to shape human capital and labor market outcomes. I study these dynamics through two lenses: (1) how incentives facilitate human capital accumulation, examining the role of teacher bonuses and educational subsidies; and (2) how safety nets affect labor supply and health capital.</p>

    <p>I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Johns Hopkins Carey Business School. I received my Ph.D. in Economics from Georgia State University, where I was advised by Professor Daniel Kreisman and worked as a Graduate Research Assistant at Georgia Policy Labs.</p>
