    <p class="greeting"><b>Hi, I'm Toufiq.</b></p>
    <p>I am an applied microeconomist specializing in causal inference, with research interests spanning education, labor economics, and applied econometrics. My current portfolio includes studies examining the effects of performance-based teacher bonuses, AP exam fee waivers, and public health insurance contractions.<br> <br>

Methodologically, my research demonstrates rigor in overcoming the challenges of causal inference. I specialize in designing identification strategies in complex settings, such as using within-student/within-teacher comparisons, exploiting specific program features (like a bonus cap), or careful application of machine learning methods to build valid counterfactuals. I also focus on contextual inferential challenges; for example, my BMI paper suggests a finite-sample correction that improves test size for inference in single treated cluster settings with limited pre-period data. My interests are also drawn to political economy, specifically voting behavior and partisan alignment in the US.</p>

    <p>I am currently a Research Assistant (Postdoc) at the Johns Hopkins Carey Business School. I received my Ph.D. in Economics from Georgia State University.</p>
