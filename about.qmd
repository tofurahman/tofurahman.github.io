<summary>TennCare through Synthetic Lens: Effect of Medicaid Disenrollment on Health (JMP)</summary>

I study the effect of Medicaid disenrollment on health exploiting Tennessee's 2005 Medicaid reform. The reform resulted in an unanticipated Medicaid coverage termination of approximately 170,000 childless adults between July 2005 and June 2006. I apply the Synthetic Difference-in-Differences method and compare Tennessee to data-driven counterfactual. Using self-reported height and weight data, I estimate a modest increase in Body Mass Index (BMI) among Tennessean childless adults, precipitating a significant rise in the share of individuals with excess body weight \[BMI\$\\geq\$25\]. The estimated effects are large for young (age 20-39) and female childless adults, who experienced relatively greater coverage shock due to the reform. Examining potential mechanisms, I find that reduction in moderate physical activity participation and consumption choice alteration partially explain the estimated weight gain. Using aggregate death counts per 100,000 population, I do not find sufficient evidence to rule out the null effect of the reform on all-cause or amenable-cause mortality.
