Leveraging this policy-induced variation, I study the impact of losing public health insurance on body weight and related health behaviors. Using Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data from 1997 to 2010, I estimate comparative case study models that compare Tennessee’s outcomes before and after the reform with those of data-driven control groups. The preferred synthetic difference-in-differences estimates suggest that the reform increased Body Mass Index by 0.37 points and the overweight or obesity prevalence (BMI≥25) by 4% among Tennessean childless adults. Examining health behaviors, I find evidence supporting weight gain through reduction in moderate physical activity participation (e.g., brisk walking, gardening) and vegetable consumption.\n\ntl;dr\n\n\n\n\n\nPDF\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \nUnlocking Potential: The Impacts of North Carolina's AP Exam Fee Waivers (with Cade Lawson)\n\nWe study the effects of North Carolina's Advanced Placement (AP) exam fee waivers on AP course enrollment, exam taking, and exam performance. Using course-level administrative data and exploiting within student variation, we identify the causal effects while overcoming several limitations of prior research. We find no evidence that fee waivers increased AP enrollment. However, fee waivers increased the likelihood of an AP course leading to an exam by 4 percentage points, with no negative impact on pass rates. The gains were significantly higher among minority and economically disadvantaged students, reducing the racial and socioeconomic gap in AP exam participation by one-third. A back-of-the-envelope cost-benefit analysis suggests that the implied tuition savings alone exceed the cost of subsidizing AP exams.\nRequest Draft\n\n\n\n\n\nSelected Work in Progress:\n\n\nHow Incentives Shape Teacher Effort: Lessons from a Piece-rate Bonus Program\n\nI study the effects of piece-rate teacher bonus program on student outcomes. Beginning 2015-16 School year, North Carolina annually rewards an Advanced Placement (AP) teacher $50 bonus for each student in her class passing the corresponding AP exam, with total bonuses capped at $3,500 ($2,000 in SY 2015-16 only). Using the program features, I develop simple economic model, which implies that the piece-rate structure and the cap provide disproportionate incentives to teachers with varying baseline student number and aptitude. Leveraging course-level student-teacher linked data from North Carolina and using both teacher fixed effects and difference-in-differences models, I provide evidence supporting the model implications. My main result suggests that the bonus program significantly increased pass rate among students assigned to teachers unconstrained by the bonus cap.\n\n\n\n\n\nEviction in the Gig Economy\n\nGig work is often taken up as a secondary profession to buffer against financial shocks. This is likely to improve timely rent payments—the leading cause of eviction filings in the United States. This paper leverages UberX/Lyft entries to major US cities to examine the effects of Gig opportunities on eviction risk. \n\n\n\n\n\nTeaching\n\n\nInstructor of Record, Georgia State University\n\n\nECON2105: Principles of Macroeconomics (Fall 2024)\n\n\nECON8220: Human Resources and Labor Markets (Spring 2025)\n\n\nTeaching Assistant, East West University, BangladeshMathematics for Business and Economics I & II, Business Finance (2011-2013)\n\n\nEducation\n\n\nGeorgia State University | Atlanta, GAPh.D. in Economics (2025, Expected)\n\nDissertation Title: Essays on Health and Education Policies  Dissertation Committee: Daniel Kreisman (Chair), Jonathan Smith, Keith Teltser, and Steven W.

Leveraging this policy-induced variation in health insurance coverage, I investigate the impact of large-scale Medicaid disenrollment on body weight and health behaviors. Using Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data from 1997 to 2010, I estimate synthetic difference-in-differences models that compare Tennessee’s outcomes before and after the reform with those of a data-driven, synthetic Tennessee. The findings indicate that the reform increased Body Mass Index (BMI) among Tennessean childless adults by 0.37 points, contributing to roughly 4% rise in the prevalence of overweight or obese individuals (BMI≥25). The effects are strong among young (aged 20-39) as well as female childless adults, who likely experienced disproportionately large coverage loss due to the reform. Examining potential mechanisms, I find that decreased participation in moderate physical activity (e.g., cycling, swimming) and dietary changes partially explain the weight gain.\n\n\n\nThe Effects of AP Exam Fee Waivers: Evidence from North Carolina (with Cade Lawsom and Salma Ali)\n\nTo be updated soon.\n\n\n\nWORK IN PROGRESS\n\n\n\nIncentive Strength and Teacher Effort: New Evidence from Piece-rate Bonus Scheme\n\n\n\n\nEviction in the Gig Economy: The Uber Effect"
