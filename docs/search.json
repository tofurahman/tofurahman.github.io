My research leverages modern econometric tools to address questions relevant to health, education, and labor policies.\nI recently completed Ph.D. in Economics from Georgia State University and will be joining Johns Hopkins University Carey Business School as a Postdoc this fall.\nClick here to view my CV.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch\n\n\n\nWorking Papers:\n\n\nDo Incentives Shape Teacher Effort? Lessons from a Piece-rate Bonus Program [Job Market Paper]  (with Ian Callen)\n\nWe study the effects of a novel piece-rate teacher bonus program on student outcomes. We propose a model implying that the piece-rate and the cap generate higher incentives for teachers with relatively lower baseline student number and aptitude. The model further predicts that the bonus program does not effectively incentivize teachers with a high baseline number of students passing the AP exams, since they are likely to automatically qualify for the maximum reward without exerting additional effort. Leveraging course-level student-teacher linked data and using both teacher fixed effects and difference-in-differences models, we provide evidence supporting the model implications. We find that the bonus program increased the probability of a course leading to a passed exam by approximately 2 percentage points. We also document an approximately 2-2.5 percentage point increase in the pass rates among students instructed by teachers for whom the bonus cap was non-binding, relative to those instructed by teachers earning near-maximum bonus amount before the program implementation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Coverage to Consequences: BMI and Health Behaviors after Medicaid Contraction\n\n\n\nLeveraging Tennessee’s 2005 Medicaid contraction, I study the impact of losing public health insurance on body weight and relevant health behaviors. Using Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data from 1997 to 2010, I estimate comparative case study models with data-driven control groups. The preferred synthetic difference-in-differences estimates suggest that the reform increased Body Mass Index by 0.38 points and the overweight or obesity prevalence (BMI≥25) by ∼4% among Tennessean childless adults. My findings—a 21% increase in the share of childless adults reporting poor health, declines in Medicaid-supported use of pain and antiinflammatory medications, and reduced participation in moderate physical activities— suggest that worsening unmanaged health conditions may be a key pathway through which coverage loss affected physical activity and weight gain. Additionally, my analysis offers practical guidance for analyzing single treated clusters using comparative case study methods, highlighting the advantages of placebo-based standard errors for valid inference.\n\ntl;dr\n\n\n\n\n\nPDF\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \nRemoving Barriers to College Credits: How and Where AP Exam Fee Waivers Work (with Cade Lawson)\n\nWe examine the impact of North Carolina's Advanced Placement (AP) exam fee waivers on exam participation and potential college credit attainment. Using course level administrative data and multiple quasi-experimental strategies, we find that fee waivers significantly increased exam participation and potential college credit attainment among high school students, particularly in underutilized AP courses, defined by below-median exam participation rates prior to the implementation of fee waivers. Although we find evidence that fee waivers reduce the exam participation gap between the underserved and more advantaged students, we do not find robust evidence that they narrow the disparity in college credit attainment. Finally, our main findings help reconcile the seemingly disparate findings from prior research on AP exam funding.\nRequest Draft\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect Work in Progress:\n\n\nReconciling BMI with Obesity Measures: A Machine Learning Approach\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEviction in the Gig Economy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR Package: propWeights\n\nImplements Proportional Weight Allocation (PWA) to distribute trade volumes in classification concordances.\n\n\n\n\n\nTeaching\n\n\nInstructor of Record, Georgia State University\n\n\nECON 2105: Principles of Macroeconomics (Fall 2024)[Syllabus]\n\n\nECON 8220: Human Resources and Labor Markets (Spring 2025)[Syllabus]\n\n\nTeaching Evaluations\n\n\nGraduate Teaching Assistant, Georgia State University \n\n\nECON 9230: Topics in Advanced Labor Economics (Spring 2025)"

Leveraging this policy-induced variation in health insurance coverage, I investigate the impact of large-scale Medicaid disenrollment on body weight and health behaviors. Using Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data from 1997 to 2010, I estimate synthetic difference-in-differences models that compare Tennessee’s outcomes before and after the reform with those of a data-driven, synthetic Tennessee. The findings indicate that the reform increased Body Mass Index (BMI) among Tennessean childless adults by 0.37 points, contributing to roughly 4% rise in the prevalence of overweight or obese individuals (BMI≥25). The effects are strong among young (aged 20-39) as well as female childless adults, who likely experienced disproportionately large coverage loss due to the reform. Examining potential mechanisms, I find that decreased participation in moderate physical activity (e.g., cycling, swimming) and dietary changes partially explain the weight gain.\n\n\n\nThe Effects of AP Exam Fee Waivers: Evidence from North Carolina (with Cade Lawsom and Salma Ali)\n\nTo be updated soon.\n\n\n\nWORK IN PROGRESS\n\n\n\nIncentive Strength and Teacher Effort: New Evidence from Piece-rate Bonus Scheme\n\n\n\n\nEviction in the Gig Economy: The Uber Effect"
