My research leverages modern econometric tools to address questions relevant to health, education, and labor policies.\nPrior to joining Georgia State University, I served as an Assistant Director at the Central Bank of Bangladesh.\nClick here to view my CV.\n\n\n\n\n\nRESEARCH\n\n\nWorking Papers:\n\n\n\nThe Effects of Losing Medicaid on Body Weight and Health Behaviors (Job Market Paper)\n\n\n\n Tennessee’s 2005 Medicaid reform resulted in approximately 4% of the state’s childless adults losing their health insurance coverage. Leveraging this policy-induced variation, I study the effects of Medicaid disenrollment on body weight and health behaviors. Using Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data from 1997 to 2010, I estimate comparative case study models that compare Tennessee’s outcomes before and after the reform with those of a data-driven control group. The results suggest that the reform led to a 0.37-point increase in BMI among Tennessean childless adults, contributing to a 4% rise in the prevalence of overweight or obese (BMI≥25) within this group. The effects were large among young adults aged 20-39 and females, who likely experienced significant coverage losses due to the reform. Examining health behaviors, I find that decreased participation in moderate physical activities (e.g., brisk walking, gardening) and inclusion of less vegetable in diet explain nearly two-third of the weight gain. Finally, the findings indicate that the effects of restricting access to Medicaid on body weight and related health behaviors may not mirror those of increasing access.\n\nPaper\nTL;DR\n\n\n\n\n  \nDo AP Exam Fee Waivers Improve AP Participation and Performance? (with Cade Lawson & Salma Ali)\n\nWe study the effects of North Carolina’s Advanced Placement (AP) exam fee\nwaivers on AP course enrollment, exam taking, and exam performance. By leveraging\ncourse-level administrative data and incorporating student fixed effects, we identify the causal effects while overcoming several limitations of prior research. We find that the fee waivers increase the likelihood of an AP course to result in an exam by 4 percentage points (∼6%), but do not significantly decrease the probability of resulting in a passing score. In contrast to previous studies, we find no evidence that the waivers increased AP enrollment. Finally, we provide evidence that the fee waivers reduced racial gap in AP participation.\nRequest Draft\n\n\n\n\n\nWork in Progress:\n\n\nIncentive Strength and Teacher Effort: New Evidence from a Piece-rate Bonus Scheme\n\n\n\n\n\nEviction in the Gig Economy\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTEACHING\n\nInstructor, Georgia State UniversityPrinciples of Macroeconomics (Fall 2024)\nTeaching Assistant, East West University, BangladeshMathematics for Business and Economics I & II, Business Finance (2011-2013)\n\n\n\nEDUCATION\n\nGeorgia State University | Atlanta, GAPh.D. in Economics (2025, Expected)"

Leveraging this policy-induced variation in health insurance coverage, I investigate the impact of large-scale Medicaid disenrollment on body weight and health behaviors. Using Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data from 1997 to 2010, I estimate synthetic difference-in-differences models that compare Tennessee’s outcomes before and after the reform with those of a data-driven, synthetic Tennessee. The findings indicate that the reform increased Body Mass Index (BMI) among Tennessean childless adults by 0.37 points, contributing to roughly 4% rise in the prevalence of overweight or obese individuals (BMI≥25). The effects are strong among young (aged 20-39) as well as female childless adults, who likely experienced disproportionately large coverage loss due to the reform. Examining potential mechanisms, I find that decreased participation in moderate physical activity (e.g., cycling, swimming) and dietary changes partially explain the weight gain.\n\n\n\nThe Effects of AP Exam Fee Waivers: Evidence from North Carolina (with Cade Lawsom and Salma Ali)\n\nTo be updated soon.\n\n\n\nWORK IN PROGRESS\n\n\n\nIncentive Strength and Teacher Effort: New Evidence from Piece-rate Bonus Scheme\n\n\n\n\nEviction in the Gig Economy: The Uber Effect"
