Leveraging this policy-induced variation in health insurance coverage, I investigate the impact of large-scale Medicaid disenrollment on body weight and health behaviors. Using Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data from 1997 to 2010, I estimate synthetic difference-in-differences models that compare Tennessee’s outcomes before and after the reform with those of a data-driven, synthetic Tennessee. The findings indicate that the reform increased Body Mass Index (BMI) among Tennessean childless adults by 0.37 points, contributing to roughly 4% rise in the prevalence of overweight or obese individuals (BMI≥25). The effects are strong among young (aged 20-39) as well as female childless adults, who likely experienced disproportionately large coverage loss due to the reform. Examining potential mechanisms, I find that decreased participation in moderate physical activity (e.g., cycling, swimming) and dietary changes partially explain the weight gain.\n\n\n\nThe Effects of AP Exam Fee Waivers: Evidence from North Carolina (with Cade Lawsom and Salma Ali)\n\nTo be updated soon.\n\n\n\n\nWORK IN PROGRESS\n\n\nIncentive Strength and Teacher Effort: New Evidence from Piece-rate Bonus Scheme\n\n\n\n\nEviction in the Gig Economy: The Uber Effect\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTEACHING\n\n\nInstructor | Georgia State University\n\n\nPrinciples of Macroeconomics (Fall, 2024)\n\n\nTeaching Assistant | East West University, Bangladesh\n\n\nMathematics for Business and Economics I (2012), Principles of Macroeconomics(2013), Business Finance (2013)\n\n\n\n\nEDUCATION\n\n\nGeorgia State University | Atlanta, GA\n\n\nPhD in Economics (2025, Expected)\n\n\nUniversity of Dhaka | Dhaka, Bangladesh\n\n\nMaster of Bank Management (2016)"
