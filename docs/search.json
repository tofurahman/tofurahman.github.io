Lessons from a Piece-rate Bonus Program\n    Job Market Paper\n  \n  with Ian Callen\n  \n  We study the effects of a novel piece-rate teacher bonus program on student outcomes. We propose a model implying that the piece-rate and the cap generate higher incentives for teachers with relatively lower baseline student number and aptitude. The model further predicts that the bonus program does not effectively incentivize teachers with a high baseline number of students passing the AP exams, since they are likely to automatically qualify for the maximum reward without exerting additional effort...\n  \n\n\n\n  \n    From Coverage to Consequences: BMI and Health Behaviors after Medicaid Contraction\n    Under Review\n  \n  \n  Leveraging Tennessee’s 2005 Medicaid contraction, I study the impact of losing public health insurance on body weight and relevant health behaviors.

Leveraging this policy-induced variation in health insurance coverage, I investigate the impact of large-scale Medicaid disenrollment on body weight and health behaviors. Using Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data from 1997 to 2010, I estimate synthetic difference-in-differences models that compare Tennessee’s outcomes before and after the reform with those of a data-driven, synthetic Tennessee. The findings indicate that the reform increased Body Mass Index (BMI) among Tennessean childless adults by 0.37 points, contributing to roughly 4% rise in the prevalence of overweight or obese individuals (BMI≥25). The effects are strong among young (aged 20-39) as well as female childless adults, who likely experienced disproportionately large coverage loss due to the reform. Examining potential mechanisms, I find that decreased participation in moderate physical activity (e.g., cycling, swimming) and dietary changes partially explain the weight gain.\n\n\n\nThe Effects of AP Exam Fee Waivers: Evidence from North Carolina (with Cade Lawsom and Salma Ali)\n\nTo be updated soon.\n\n\n\nWORK IN PROGRESS\n\n\n\nIncentive Strength and Teacher Effort: New Evidence from Piece-rate Bonus Scheme\n\n\n\n\nEviction in the Gig Economy: The Uber Effect"

    "text": "The Effects of Losing Medicaid on Body Weight and Health Behaviors\n\nWHY?\nWhile prior research documented the effects of gaining Medicaid coverage on Body Mass Index (BMI) and related health behaviors and led to diverging conclusions, there is a notable gap in understanding the effects of losing Medicaid.\n\n\nHOW?\nI exploit variation in health insurance coverage induced by Tennessee’s 2005 Medicaid reform, which abruptly terminated health insurance coverage for approximately 4% (170,000) of Tennessee’s childless adults.\nUsing BRFSS data from 1997 to 2010, I estimate comparative case study models that compare Tennessee’s pre- and post-reform outcomes to those of data-driven control groups’.
