Leveraging this policy-induced variation in health insurance coverage, I investigate the impact of large-scale Medicaid disenrollment on body weight and health behaviors. Using Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data from 1997 to 2010, I estimate synthetic difference-in-differences models that compare Tennessee’s outcomes before and after the reform with those of a data-driven, synthetic Tennessee. The findings indicate that the reform increased Body Mass Index (BMI) among Tennessean childless adults by 0.37 points, contributing to roughly 4% rise in the prevalence of overweight or obese individuals (BMI≥25). The effects are strong among young (aged 20-39) as well as female childless adults, who likely experienced disproportionately large coverage loss due to the reform. Examining potential mechanisms, I find that decreased participation in moderate physical activity (e.g., cycling, swimming) and dietary changes partially explain the weight gain.\n      \n      \n      \n      The Effects of AP Exam Fee Waivers: Evidence from North Carolina (with Cade Lawsom and Salma Ali)\n      \n      To be updated soon.\n      \n      \n      \n      WORK IN PROGRESS\n      \n      \n      \n      Incentive Strength and Teacher Effort: New Evidence from Piece-rate Bonus Scheme\n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Eviction in the Gig Economy: The Uber Effect"

    "text": "Job Market Paper\n        \n              \n          Public Health Insurance and Employment Lock: Resolving the TennCare Puzzle*\n          Under Review\n          \n            [Draft]\n            [Replication kit]\n            [Abstract]\n          \n\n          \n            Evaluations of the 2005 TennCare disenrollment yield conflicting estimates, ranging from large employment increases to precise nulls. I show that conflating self-employment with benefits-eligible jobs drives this discrepancy. Analyzing wage employment—the margin relevant for insurance access—I find robust evidence of employment lock, strictly concentrated among the older, less-educated childless adults in Tennessee. The findings demonstrate that employment lock is not a generalized response to the loss of in-kind transfers, but a corner solution necessitated by the interaction of high health risk and a binding uninsurability constraint.\n      \n          \n        \n        \n\n\n      \n        Working Papers\n          \n          The Anatomy of a Piece-rate Teacher Bonus Program*\n          with Ian Callen\n          \n            [PDF]\n            [Abstract]\n          \n          \n          \n            A central tenet of economics is that agents respond to incentives, yet the real-world effects of performance pay remain a puzzle. Simple models predict a direct increase in effort, while critics warn of a narrow targeted effort. This paper provides new evidence on this debate by studying a statewide bonus program that rewards Advanced Placement (AP) teachers a piece-rate for each student in their class passing the standardized test. We use marginal analysis to show that the bonus induces targeted effort and to explain the mechanisms driving variation in incentive strength, which we test empirically. Using student-course level data linked to teachers and a difference-in-differences design, we first document a significant average effect: the program increased student pass rates by 2.4 percentage points. We then decompose this average effect and report two key insights. First, contrary to the \"teaching to the bubble\" hypothesis, we find robust evidence of gains concentrated at the top of the AP score distribution. Second, we document heterogeneity across multiple dimensions, suggesting that the success of performance pay is jointly determined by the design of the incentive, the nature of the task, and the agent's baseline performance and workload.\n          \n        \n\n        \n          Removing Barriers to College Credits: Where and for Whom AP Exam Fee Waivers Work*\n          with Cade Lawson\n          Under Review\n          \n            [PDF]\n            [Abstract]\n          \n\n          \n            Do policies that broaden educational access also foster success? We study this question by analyzing North Carolina’s universal Advanced Placement (AP) exam fee waiver policy. Using student-course level administrative data, we exploit within-student variation on a sample of students who took multiple AP courses to estimate the policy's effect on exam participation (access) and pass rates (success). We find that the fee waivers significantly increased exam participation but had no overall effect on the pass rate for these enrollees. This, however, masks a robust 3 percentage point increase in the pass rates among low-SES students. We also find imprecise but suggestive evidence of gains among underrepresented minorities (non-Asian and non-White). A complementary analysis, leveraging the full sample of AP courses, shows that fee waivers had the greatest impact in courses where predicted financial barriers to exam participation were highest, and that the policy's benefits far exceed its cost. Finally, our results help reconcile the seemingly disparate findings from prior work on AP exam funding.\n          \n        \n\n        \n          Medicaid and Health Resilience: Evidence from TennCare Disenrollment*\n          Under Review\n          \n            [PDF]\n            [Abstract]\n          \n\n          \n            Does public health insurance mitigate the functional consequences of adverse health shocks? I investigate this question by exploiting variation induced by Tennessee's 2005 Medicaid disenrollment, which abruptly terminated coverage for approximately 170,000 childless adults. Using Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data from 1997 to 2010 and a difference-in-differences design, I estimate Intent-to-Treat effects. I first document that the reform significantly increased the uninsured rate and led to a deterioration in observable health capital, marked by a 15% rise in severe obesity prevalence and the share of respondents reporting 'poor' health status. I then document a puzzle: while reported days of functional incapacitation increased by 27%, the underlying frequency of physical and mental symptom days remained statistically unchanged. I reconcile this divergence by showing that the \"incapacitation ratio\"—the probability that a symptom day leads to incapacitation—increased by 17%. These findings suggest that public health insurance functions as a technological buffer, enhancing resilience and preventing adverse health symptoms from disrupting daily functioning.\n          \n        \n        \n        \n          The Gig Safety Net: Platform Labor and Eviction*\n          \n            [Draft coming soon.]\n            [Abstract]\n          \n\n          \n            I study the effect of the gig economy on housing stability. Using county-level administrative data, I find that an increase of one gig driver per 1,000 working-age population reduces the eviction filing rate by 0.23 percentage points (5%). I also find a modest reduction in eviction judgments (-0.07 pp), suggesting that gig work is more effective at preventing initial delinquency than reversing deep insolvency. These effects are substantially larger when excluding major metropolitan areas, consistent with the gig economy functioning as a 'safety net of last resort' in thinner labor markets. A battery of sensitivity and falsification tests supports the liquidity channel.\n          \n        \n        \n\n        Selected Work in Progress\n        \n        \n          \n            The Contribution of Firms to Voting Behavior\n            (with Michael Luca, Daniel Kreisman, Jonathan Smith)\n          \n          \n            Gains, Losses, and Stickiness in Public Finance: Evidence from 3,000 School Tax Referenda*\n            (with Cade Lawson)\n          \n          \n            Fiscal Federalism and the Paradox of Voting: How Local Ballots Solve the Participation Puzzle*\n          \n        \n\n      \n\n\n      \n      * indicates first-authored paper."
