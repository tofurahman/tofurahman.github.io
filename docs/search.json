Leveraging this policy-induced variation in health insurance coverage, I investigate the impact of large-scale Medicaid disenrollment on body weight and health behaviors. Using Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data from 1997 to 2010, I estimate synthetic difference-in-differences models that compare Tennessee’s outcomes before and after the reform with those of a data-driven, synthetic Tennessee. The findings indicate that the reform increased Body Mass Index (BMI) among Tennessean childless adults by 0.37 points, contributing to roughly 4% rise in the prevalence of overweight or obese individuals (BMI≥25). The effects are strong among young (aged 20-39) as well as female childless adults, who likely experienced disproportionately large coverage loss due to the reform. Examining potential mechanisms, I find that decreased participation in moderate physical activity (e.g., cycling, swimming) and dietary changes partially explain the weight gain.\n      \n      \n      \n      The Effects of AP Exam Fee Waivers: Evidence from North Carolina (with Cade Lawsom and Salma Ali)\n      \n      To be updated soon.\n      \n      \n      \n      WORK IN PROGRESS\n      \n      \n      \n      Incentive Strength and Teacher Effort: New Evidence from Piece-rate Bonus Scheme\n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Eviction in the Gig Economy: The Uber Effect"

Using student-course level administrative data from North Carolina, we estimate the effect of the program by exploiting within-teacher variation over time, while controlling for student composition and sorting using a comprehensive set of student, grade, and course fixed effects. We complement this approach with a difference-in-differences strategy, where teachers unincentivized by the program, due to a bonus cap, make up a credible control group. We find that the bonus program increased an AP enrollee's exam passing probability by 2.5 percentage points, an effect driven by broad-based improvement in achievement rather than bunching at the passing threshold. Decomposing this effect, we find that the bonus's impact was concentrated in a specific subset of academic subjects and was stronger where the incentive strength was higher.\n        \n      \n\n      \n        Removing Barriers to College Credits: Where and for Whom AP Exam Fee Waivers Work\n\n        \n          \n            with Cade Lawson\n            ► Abstract\n          \n          \n            \n            \n              PDF\n            \n          \n        \n\n        \n          Do policies that broaden educational access also foster success? We study this question in the context of North Carolina’s universal Advanced Placement (AP) exam fee waiver policy, analyzing its effects on the likelihood of exam participation and achieving a passing score (&gt;=3 out of 5). Using administrative data and exploiting within-student variation, we find that fee waivers boost AP exam participation but not the overall pass rate among AP-enrolled students. This, however, masks a robust 3 percentage point increase in the pass rates among low-SES students. We also find imprecise but suggestive evidence of gains among underrepresented minorities (non-Asian and non-White) and underutilized AP courses, defined by below median exam participation rate in the pre-waiver period. A complementary analysis, leveraging the full sample of AP courses, shows that fee waivers had the greatest impact in courses where predicted financial barriers were highest, and that the policy's benefits far exceed its cost. Finally, our results help reconcile the seemingly disparate findings from prior work on AP exam funding.\n        \n      \n\n\n      \n        From Coverage to Consequences: BMI, Health Behaviors, and Self-rated Health After Medicaid Contraction\n\n        \n          \n            \n            ► Abstract\n          \n          \n            Under Review\n            \n              PDF\n              arXiv\n            \n          \n        \n\n        \n          Leveraging Tennessee's 2005 Medicaid contraction, I study the impact of losing public health insurance on body weight and relevant health behaviors. Using Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data from 1997 to 2010, I estimate synthetic difference-in-differences models. The estimates suggest that the reform increased Body Mass Index by 0.38 points and the overweight or obesity prevalence (BMI&gt;=25) by ~4% among Tennessean childless adults. My findings -- a 21% increase in the share of childless adults reporting ``poor'' health status (the lowest level on the five-point scale), a reduction in Medicaid-reimbursed utilization of pain and anti-inflammatory medications, and a reduction in participation in moderate physical activities -- suggest that worsening unmanaged health conditions may be a key pathway through which coverage loss affected weight gain. Additionally, my analysis offers practical guidance for conducting robust inference in single treated cluster settings with limited pre-treatment data.\n        \n      \n\n      \n      \n      \n      Work in Progress:\n      \n      The Contribution of Firms to Voting Behavior (with Michael Luca, Daniel Kreisman, Jonathan Smith)\n      Gentrification and the Price of Higher Education\n      The Capitalized Cost of Environmental Regulation on Used Car Values: Evidence from a Regression Discontinuity Design (with Cade Lawson)"
