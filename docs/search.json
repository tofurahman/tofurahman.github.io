My research leverages modern econometric tools to answer policy-relevant questions. My interest spans across topics in health, education, and labor economics.\n \n  \n   \n  \n     CV\n  \n  \n     Contact\n  \n  \n    \n     GitHub\n  \n  \n     Research Statement\n  \n  \n     Teaching Statement\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nRESEARCH\n\n\nWorking Papers:\n\n\nEffects of Losing Medicaid on Body Weight and Health Behaviors (Job Market Paper)PaperSlides\n\n\nTennessee’s 2005 Medicaid reform resulted in approximately 4% of Tennessean childless adults losing their coverage. Leveraging this policy-induced variation, I study the effects of large-scale Medicaid disenrollment on body weight and health behaviors. Using Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data from 1997 to 2010, I estimate synthetic difference-in-differences models that compare Tennessee’s outcomes before and after the reform with those of a data-driven, synthetic Tennessee. The findings indicate that the reform increased Body Mass Index (BMI) among Tennessean childless adults by 0.37 points, contributing to roughly 4% rise in the prevalence of overweight or obese individuals (BMI≥25). The effects are strong among young (aged 20-39) as well as female childless adults, who likely experienced large coverage loss due to the reform. Examining health behaviors, I find that decreased participation in moderate physical activity (e.g., cycling, swimming) and dietary changes partially explain the weight gain.\n\n\n\n\nThe Effects of AP Exam Fee Waivers: Evidence from North Carolina (with Cade Lawsom and Salma Ali)Request Draft\n\n\nWe leverage policy-induced variation in the out-of-pocket cost of taking Advanced Placement (AP) exams and within student variation to examine the effects of North Carolina’s AP exam fee waiver policy on AP course enrollment, exam taking, and exam performance. Our use of course-level administrative data and student fixed effects address several limitations of prior studies. We find that the fee waivers increase the likelihood of an AP enrollee to take the AP test, but does not decrease the probability of passing the test. In contrast to previous studies, we find no effect on AP course enrollment. We provide evidence that fee waivers reduce racial gap in AP exam taking and potential college credit accumulation.\n\n\n\n\n\nWork in Progress:\n\n\nIncentive Strength and Teacher Effort: New Evidence from Piece-rate Bonus Scheme\n\n\n\n\nEviction in the Gig Economy: The Uber Effect\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTEACHING\n\nInstructor, Georgia State UniversityPrinciples of Macroeconomics (Fall 2024)\nTeaching Assistant, East West University, BangladeshMathematics for Business and Economics I & II, Business Finance (2011-2013)\n\n\n\nEDUCATION\n\nGeorgia State University | Atlanta, GAPh.D. in Economics (2025, Expected)"
