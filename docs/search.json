Leveraging this policy-induced variation in health insurance coverage, I investigate the impact of large-scale Medicaid disenrollment on body weight and health behaviors. Using Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data from 1997 to 2010, I estimate synthetic difference-in-differences models that compare Tennessee’s outcomes before and after the reform with those of a data-driven, synthetic Tennessee. The findings indicate that the reform increased Body Mass Index (BMI) among Tennessean childless adults by 0.37 points, contributing to roughly 4% rise in the prevalence of overweight or obese individuals (BMI≥25). The effects are strong among young (aged 20-39) as well as female childless adults, who likely experienced disproportionately large coverage loss due to the reform. Examining potential mechanisms, I find that decreased participation in moderate physical activity (e.g., cycling, swimming) and dietary changes partially explain the weight gain.\n      \n      \n      \n      The Effects of AP Exam Fee Waivers: Evidence from North Carolina (with Cade Lawsom and Salma Ali)\n      \n      To be updated soon.\n      \n      \n      \n      WORK IN PROGRESS\n      \n      \n      \n      Incentive Strength and Teacher Effort: New Evidence from Piece-rate Bonus Scheme\n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Eviction in the Gig Economy: The Uber Effect"

    "text": "Working Papers:\n      \n        The Anatomy of a Piece-rate Teacher Bonus Program\n        \n          \n            with Ian Callen\n            ► Abstract\n          \n          \n            Job Market Paper\n            \n              Draft\n            \n          \n        \n\n        \n          A central tenet of economics is that agents respond to incentives, yet the real-world effects of performance pay remain a puzzle. Simple models predict a direct increase in effort, while critics warn of a narrow targeted effort. This paper provides new evidence on this debate by studying a statewide bonus program that rewards Advanced Placement (AP) teachers a piece-rate for each student in their class passing the standardized test. We use marginal analysis to show that the bonus induces targeted effort and to explain the mechanisms driving variation in incentive strength, which we test empirically. Using student-course level data linked to teachers and a difference-in-differences design, we first document a significant average effect: the program increased student pass rates by 2.4 percentage points. We then decompose this average effect and report two key insights. First, contrary to the \"teaching to the bubble\" hypothesis, we find robust evidence of gains concentrated at the top of the AP score distribution. Second, we document heterogeneity across multiple dimensions, suggesting that the success of performance pay is jointly determined by the design of the incentive, the nature of the task, and the agent's baseline performance and workload.\n        \n      \n\n      \n        Removing Barriers to College Credits: Where and for Whom AP Exam Fee Waivers Work\n\n        \n          \n            with Cade Lawson\n            ► Abstract\n          \n          \n            Submitted\n            \n              EdWorkingPapers\n            \n          \n        \n\n        \n          Do policies that broaden educational access also foster success? We study this question by analyzing North Carolina’s universal Advanced Placement (AP) exam fee waiver. Using student-course level administrative data, we exploit within-student variation on a sample of students who took multiple AP courses to estimate the policy's effect on exam participation (access) and pass rates (success). We find that the fee waivers significantly increased exam participation but had no overall effect on the pass rate for these enrollees. This, however, masks a robust 3 percentage point increase in the pass rates among low-SES students. We also find imprecise but suggestive evidence of gains among underrepresented minorities (non-Asian and non-White). A complementary analysis, leveraging the full sample of AP courses, shows that fee waivers had the greatest impact in courses where predicted financial barriers to exam participation were highest, and that the policy's benefits far exceed its cost. Finally, our results help reconcile the seemingly disparate findings from prior work on AP exam funding.\n        \n      \n\n\n      \n        From Coverage to Consequences: BMI, Health Behaviors, and Self-rated Health After Medicaid Contraction\n\n        \n          \n            \n            ► Abstract\n          \n          \n            Under Review\n            \n              ArXiv\n            \n          \n        \n\n        \n          Leveraging Tennessee's 2005 Medicaid contraction, I study the impact of losing public health insurance on body weight and relevant health behaviors. Using Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data from 1997 to 2010, I estimate synthetic difference-in-differences models. The estimates suggest that the reform increased Body Mass Index by 0.38 points and the overweight or obesity prevalence (BMI&gt;=25) by ~4% among Tennessean childless adults. My findings -- a 21% increase in the share of childless adults reporting ``poor'' health status (the lowest level on the five-point scale), a reduction in Medicaid-reimbursed utilization of pain and anti-inflammatory medications, and a reduction in participation in moderate physical activities -- suggest that worsening unmanaged health conditions may be a key pathway through which coverage loss affected weight gain. Additionally, my analysis offers practical guidance for conducting robust inference in single treated cluster settings with limited pre-treatment data.\n        \n      \n\n      \n      \n      \n      Work in Progress:\n      \n      The Contribution of Firms to Voting Behavior (with Michael Luca, Daniel Kreisman, Jonathan Smith)\n      Gains, Losses, and Stickiness in Public Finance: Evidence from 3,000 School Tax Referenda\n      Gentrification and the Price of Higher Education\n      Local Shocks and the Nationalization of US Politics\n      The Capitalized Cost of Environmental Regulation on Used Car Values: Evidence from a Regression Discontinuity Design (with Cade Lawson)\n      \n        \n         \n          View my Research Statement →"

    "text": "Hi, I'm Toufiq.\n          I am an applied microeconomist. My research spans several fields, with primary interest in applied econometrics, labor economics, and economics of education. My current portfolio includes studies examining the effects of performance-based teacher bonuses, AP exam fee waivers, and public health insurance contractions. \n\n      Methodologically, my research demonstrates rigor in overcoming the challenges of causal inference. I specialize in designing identification strategies in complex settings, such as using within-student/within-teacher comparisons, exploiting specific program features (like a bonus cap), or careful application of machine learning methods to build valid counterfactuals. I also focus on contextual inferential challenges; for example, my BMI paper suggests a finite-sample correction that improves test size for inference in single treated cluster settings with limited pre-period data.\n\n          I am currently a Research Assistant (Postdoc) at the Johns Hopkins Carey Business School. I received my Ph.D. in Economics from Georgia State University, where I was advised by Professor Daniel Kreisman and worked as a Graduate Research Assistant at Georgia Policy Labs.\n\n      \n        \n          \n          LinkedIn\n        \n        \n          \n          CV\n        \n        \n          \n          JMP\n        \n        \n          \n          Email"
