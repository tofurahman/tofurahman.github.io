    "text": "Working Papers\n\n\nTennCare through Synthetic Lens: Effect of Medicaid Disenrollment on Health (JMP)\n\nI study the effect of Medicaid disenrollment on health exploiting Tennesseeâ€™s 2005 Medicaid reform. The reform resulted in an unanticipated Medicaid coverage termination of approximately 170,000 childless adults between July 2005 and June 2006. I apply the Synthetic Difference-in-Differences method and compare Tennessee to data-driven counterfactual. Using self-reported height and weight data, I estimate a modest increase in Body Mass Index (BMI) among Tennessean childless adults, precipitating a significant rise in the share of individuals with excess body weight [BMI$\\geq$25]. The estimated effects are large for young (age 20-39) and female childless adults, who experienced relatively greater coverage shock due to the reform. Examining potential mechanisms, I find that reduction in moderate physical activity participation and consumption choice alteration partially explain the estimated weight gain. Using aggregate death counts per 100,000 population, I do not find sufficient evidence to rule out the null effect of the reform on all-cause or amenable-cause mortality.\n\n\n\nAP Exam Fee Waivers and College Prep Outcomes (with Cade Lawsom and Salma Ali)\n\nTo be updated soon.\n\n\n\nWork in Progress\n\nIncentive Strength and Teacher Effort: New Evidence from Piece-rate Bonus Scheme\nEviction in Gig Economy: The Uber Effect"
