Leveraging this policy-induced variation in health insurance coverage, I investigate the impact of large-scale Medicaid disenrollment on body weight and health behaviors. Using Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data from 1997 to 2010, I estimate synthetic difference-in-differences models that compare Tennessee’s outcomes before and after the reform with those of a data-driven, synthetic Tennessee. The findings indicate that the reform increased Body Mass Index (BMI) among Tennessean childless adults by 0.37 points, contributing to roughly 4% rise in the prevalence of overweight or obese individuals (BMI≥25). The effects are strong among young (aged 20-39) as well as female childless adults, who likely experienced disproportionately large coverage loss due to the reform. Examining potential mechanisms, I find that decreased participation in moderate physical activity (e.g., cycling, swimming) and dietary changes partially explain the weight gain.\n      \n      \n      \n      The Effects of AP Exam Fee Waivers: Evidence from North Carolina (with Cade Lawsom and Salma Ali)\n      \n      To be updated soon.\n      \n      \n      \n      WORK IN PROGRESS\n      \n      \n      \n      Incentive Strength and Teacher Effort: New Evidence from Piece-rate Bonus Scheme\n      \n      \n      \n      \n      Eviction in the Gig Economy: The Uber Effect"

Simple models predict a direct increase in effort, while critics warn of a narrow targeted effort. This paper provides new evidence on this debate by studying a statewide bonus program that rewards Advanced Placement (AP) teachers a piece-rate for each student in their class passing the standardized test. We use marginal analysis to show that the bonus induces targeted effort and to explain the mechanisms driving variation in incentive strength, which we test empirically. Using student-course level data linked to teachers and a difference-in-differences design, we first document a significant average effect: the program increased student pass rates by 2.4 percentage points. We then decompose this average effect and report two key insights. First, contrary to the \"teaching to the bubble\" hypothesis, we find robust evidence of gains concentrated at the top of the AP score distribution. Second, we document heterogeneity across multiple dimensions, suggesting that the success of performance pay is jointly determined by the design of the incentive, the nature of the task, and the agent's baseline performance and workload.\n        \n      \n\n      \n        Removing Barriers to College Credits: Where and for Whom AP Exam Fee Waivers Work\n\n        \n          \n            with Cade Lawson\n            ► Abstract\n          \n          \n            \n            \n              PDF\n            \n          \n        \n\n        \n          Do policies that broaden educational access also foster success? We study this question in the context of North Carolina’s universal Advanced Placement (AP) exam fee waiver policy, analyzing its effects on the likelihood of exam participation and achieving a passing score (&gt;=3 out of 5). Using administrative data and exploiting within-student variation, we find that fee waivers boost AP exam participation but not the overall pass rate among AP-enrolled students. This, however, masks a robust 3 percentage point increase in the pass rates among low-SES students. We also find imprecise but suggestive evidence of gains among underrepresented minorities (non-Asian and non-White). A complementary analysis, leveraging the full sample of AP courses, shows that fee waivers had the greatest impact in courses where predicted financial barriers were highest, and that the policy's benefits far exceed its cost. Finally, our results help reconcile the seemingly disparate findings from prior work on AP exam funding.\n        \n      \n\n\n      \n        From Coverage to Consequences: BMI, Health Behaviors, and Self-rated Health After Medicaid Contraction\n\n        \n          \n            \n            ► Abstract\n          \n          \n            Under Review\n            \n              PDF\n              arXiv\n            \n          \n        \n\n        \n          Leveraging Tennessee's 2005 Medicaid contraction, I study the impact of losing public health insurance on body weight and relevant health behaviors. Using Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data from 1997 to 2010, I estimate synthetic difference-in-differences models. The estimates suggest that the reform increased Body Mass Index by 0.38 points and the overweight or obesity prevalence (BMI&gt;=25) by ~4% among Tennessean childless adults. My findings -- a 21% increase in the share of childless adults reporting ``poor'' health status (the lowest level on the five-point scale), a reduction in Medicaid-reimbursed utilization of pain and anti-inflammatory medications, and a reduction in participation in moderate physical activities -- suggest that worsening unmanaged health conditions may be a key pathway through which coverage loss affected weight gain.

    "text": "Hi, I'm Toufiq.\n          I am an applied microeconomist specializing in causal inference, with research interests spanning education, labor economics, and applied econometrics. My current portfolio includes studies examining the effects of performance-based teacher bonuses, AP exam fee waivers, and public health insurance contractions. \n\n      Methodologically, my research demonstrates rigor in overcoming the challenges of causal inference. I specialize in designing identification strategies in complex settings, such as using within-student/within-teacher comparisons or exploiting specific program features (like a bonus cap) to build valid counterfactuals. I also focus on contextual inferential challenges; for example, my BMI paper suggests a finite-sample correction that improves test size for inference in single treated cluster settings with limited pre-period data. My interests are also drawn to political economy, specifically voting behavior and partisan alignment in the US.\n\n          I am currently a Research Assistant (Postdoc) at the Johns Hopkins Carey Business School.
