Leveraging this policy-induced variation, I study the effects of Medicaid disenrollment on body weight and health behaviors. Using Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data from 1997 to 2010, I estimate comparative case study models that compare Tennessee's outcomes before and after the reform with those of a data-driven control group. The preferred synthetic difference-in-differences estimates suggest that the reform led to 0.37 kg/m^2 increase in body weight among Tennessean childless adults, contributing to a 4% rise in the prevalence of overweight or obese (BMI≥25) within this group. The effects were large among young adults aged 20 to 39 years and women, who likely experienced significant coverage losses due to the reform. Examining health behaviors, I find that decreased participation in moderate physical activities (e.g., brisk walking, gardening) and a reduction in vegetable consumption explain nearly two-third of the weight gain. Finally, the findings indicate that the effects of reducing Medicaid coverage on body weight and related health behaviors may not mirror those of increasing Medicaid access.\n\nPaper\n\n\n\n\n  \nDo AP Exam Fee Waivers Improve AP Participation and Performance? (with Cade Lawson & Salma Ali)\n\nWe study the effects of North Carolina’s Advanced Placement (AP) exam fee waivers on AP course enrollment, exam taking, and exam performance. Using course-level administrative data and exploiting within student variation, we identify the causal effects while overcoming several limitations of prior research. We find that fee waivers increased the likelihood of an AP course resulting in an exam by 4 percentage points (∼6%), but did not significantly decrease the probability of leading to a passing score. In contrast to previous studies, we do not find sufficient evidence that waivers increased AP enrollment. Finally, we provide evidence that fee waivers reduced the racial gap in AP participation and performance.\nRequest Draft\n\n\n\n\n\nWork in Progress:\n\n\nIncentive Strength and Teacher Effort: New Evidence from a Piece-rate Bonus Scheme\n\n\n\n\n\nEviction in the Gig Economy\n\n\n\n\n\nTeaching\n\n\nInstructor, Georgia State UniversityPrinciples of Macroeconomics (Fall 2024)\nTeaching Assistant, East West University, BangladeshMathematics for Business and Economics I & II, Business Finance (2011-2013)\n\n\nEducation\n\n\nGeorgia State University | Atlanta, GAPh.D. in Economics (2025, Expected)"

Leveraging this policy-induced variation in health insurance coverage, I investigate the impact of large-scale Medicaid disenrollment on body weight and health behaviors. Using Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data from 1997 to 2010, I estimate synthetic difference-in-differences models that compare Tennessee’s outcomes before and after the reform with those of a data-driven, synthetic Tennessee. The findings indicate that the reform increased Body Mass Index (BMI) among Tennessean childless adults by 0.37 points, contributing to roughly 4% rise in the prevalence of overweight or obese individuals (BMI≥25). The effects are strong among young (aged 20-39) as well as female childless adults, who likely experienced disproportionately large coverage loss due to the reform. Examining potential mechanisms, I find that decreased participation in moderate physical activity (e.g., cycling, swimming) and dietary changes partially explain the weight gain.\n\n\n\nThe Effects of AP Exam Fee Waivers: Evidence from North Carolina (with Cade Lawsom and Salma Ali)\n\nTo be updated soon.\n\n\n\nWORK IN PROGRESS\n\n\n\nIncentive Strength and Teacher Effort: New Evidence from Piece-rate Bonus Scheme\n\n\n\n\nEviction in the Gig Economy: The Uber Effect"

    "text": "The Effects of Losing Medicaid on Body Weight and Health Behaviors\n\nWHY?\nWhile prior research documented the effects of gaining Medicaid coverage on Body Mass Index (BMI) and related health behaviors and led to diverging conclusions, there is a notable gap in understanding the effects of losing Medicaid.\n\n\nHOW?\nI exploit variation in health insurance coverage induced by Tennessee’s 2005 Medicaid reform, which abruptly terminated health insurance coverage for approximately 4% (170,000) of Tennessee’s childless adults.\nUsing BRFSS data from 1997 to 2010, I estimate comparative case study models that compare Tennessee’s pre- and post-reform outcomes to those of data-driven control groups’. Specifically, for body weight outcomes, I estimates difference-in-differences, synthetic difference-in-differences, and synthetic control methods.\n\n\nWHAT?\nThe results of my pre\nI find that following\nContributions:\nThe use of SDiD in the Tennessee’s setting addresses two potential problems in the analysis of single treated clusters.\n\nStandard DiD methods may severely understate the standard errors.\nThe bias from nonparallel evolution of outcomes between the treated and control states may result in severely overstating a given effect.\n\nI provide empirical evidence to highlight these problems by re-examining the estimates of a few prior studies."
