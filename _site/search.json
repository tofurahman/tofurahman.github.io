Leveraging this policy-induced variation in health insurance coverage, I investigate the impact of large-scale Medicaid disenrollment on body weight and health behaviors. Using Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data from 1997 to 2010, I estimate synthetic difference-in-differences models that compare Tennessee’s outcomes before and after the reform with those of a data-driven, synthetic Tennessee. The findings indicate that the reform increased Body Mass Index (BMI) among Tennessean childless adults by 0.37 points, contributing to roughly 4% rise in the prevalence of overweight or obese individuals (BMI≥25). The effects are strong among young (aged 20-39) as well as female childless adults, who likely experienced disproportionately large coverage loss due to the reform. Examining potential mechanisms, I find that decreased participation in moderate physical activity (e.g., cycling, swimming) and dietary changes partially explain the weight gain.\n\n\n\nThe Effects of AP Exam Fee Waivers: Evidence from North Carolina (with Cade Lawsom and Salma Ali)\n\nTo be updated soon.\n\n\n\nWORK IN PROGRESS\n\n\n\nIncentive Strength and Teacher Effort: New Evidence from Piece-rate Bonus Scheme\n\n\n\n\nEviction in the Gig Economy: The Uber Effect"

I show that conflating self-employment with benefits-eligible jobs drives this discrepancy. Analyzing wage employment—the margin relevant for insurance access—I find robust evidence of labor supply expansion, strictly concentrated among the older, less-educated childless adults in Tennessee. The findings demonstrate that the estimated labor supply expansion is not a generalized response to the loss of in-kind transfers, but rather a specific manifestation of employment lock, driven by the interaction of high health risk and binding uninsurability.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  Working Papers\n\n  \n    The Anatomy of a Piece-rate Teacher Bonus Program\n    \n      with Ian Callen |\n      PDF\n      /\n      Abstract\n    \n\n    \n      A central tenet of economics is that agents respond to incentives, yet the real-world effects of performance pay remain a puzzle.

    "text": "Hi, I'm Toufiq.\n    I am an applied microeconomist specializing in education, labor, and public economics. My research agenda investigates how public policy design interacts with market frictions to shape human capital and labor market outcomes. I study these dynamics through two lenses: (1) how incentives facilitate human capital accumulation, examining the role of teacher bonuses and educational subsidies; and (2) how safety nets affect labor supply and health capital.\n\n    I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Johns Hopkins Carey Business School.
